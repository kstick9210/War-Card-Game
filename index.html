            <p>The goal is to be the first player to win all 52 cards.<br><br>
                THE DEAL<br>
                The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, 
                dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player 
                places their stack of cards face down, in front of them.<br><br>
                THE PLAY<br>
                Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher 
                card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.
                Aces are high. If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up one
                additional card face up. The player with the higher card takes both piles (four cards).
                If the turned up cards are again the same rank, each player turns up one additional card
                face up. The player with the higher card takes all six cards, and so on.<br><br>
                HOW TO KEEP SCORE<br>
                The game ends when one player has won all the cards.<br><br>
